# Quantifying-Relative-Soccer-League-Strength

Arguing about domestic league strength is something that soccer fans seems to never tire of. (“Could Messi do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke?”) Many of these conversations are anecdotal, leading to “hot takes” that are unfalsifiable. While we’ll probably never move away from these kinds of discussions, we can at least try to inform them with a quantitative approach.

Perhaps the obvious way to do so is to take match results from international tournaments (e.g. Champions League, Europa). But such an approach can be flawed—there’s not a large sample, and match results may not be reflective of “true” team strength (e.g. one team may win on xG by a large margin, but lose the game.)
